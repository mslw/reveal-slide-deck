I wanted to work with reveal.js as a submodule, and keep all changes
(presentations, but also package-lock file) outside of the reveal.js
directory, to make updating easier. To this end, my installation
procedure was as follows:

- add the submodule
  =git submodule add https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git=
- initialize npm and install reveal.js in the top-level directory:

  - =npm init= (will create =package.json= interactively)
  - =npm install ./reveal.js --save= (will create =node_modules= which
    should be excluded from git, and =package_lock.json=)

- add ="start": "gulp serve"= to ="scripts"= in =package.json=
- symlink =gulpfile.js= with =ln -s reveal.js/gulpfile.js=
- copy the example =index.html= file from the =reveal.js= directory,
  and edit paths to scripts (css/js) to include the =reveal.js=
  directory

*** Starting from this repo
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: starting-from-this-repo

To start with this repo on another machine, it would probably go like
this:

- clone this repo and get the submodule content:

  - either when cloning, =git clone --recurse-submodules <this repo>=
  - or, after cloning, =git submodule init= and =git submodule update=

- install =reveal.js=

  - =npm install= alone should do it (or =npm ci=)
  - if there are errors, remove =package-lock.json= and try again (for
    some reason, =fsevents= used to make its way to the =package.lock=
    file, even though it is MacOS only)

** Usage

Running =npm start= in the top level directory should launch a server at
=http://localhost:8000=.
